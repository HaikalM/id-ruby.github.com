Wishing us the miracle of forgiving and letting go

We have cleaned soul and heart with fasting. The dirt which has been with us is cleansed now.

Some stress comes from fasting, but the invisible treasure of heart is with us. Ramadan came to the heartâ€™s temple;

The one who created heart is with us.

(Jallaludin Ar-Rumi)
